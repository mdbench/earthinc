### About Earth, Inc.
Earth, Inc. is based on the principle we need to rethink our approach to Earth-related problems. Business problems are easier to translate, as the pocketbook talks. We want you to think of the world as a gigantic corporation that is slowly becoming incorporated with employees that stretch a vast geographical area.There are a ton of regional managers and we are all employees. Bankruptcy hurts the company, whether its your department or not. 

Let's leverage this paradigm to make Earth a safer place by giving up a small fraction of our time in ways that minimize time lost. Earth, Inc. leverages randomization to send your search queries to cause-based search engines. These cause-based search engines use money they earn through advertisement dollars to help the Earth. 

If you chose just one cause, you could create a lop-sided arrangement. Plant too many trees, people will stop caring about trees eventually. Give too much water and people will think we have solved problems of water, only for them to sprout back up in the future worse than they are now. Solving Earth-related problems requires innovation and focus. That's where Earth, Inc. comes in...

If we randomize the cause-based engines you search, an equal amount of benefit is derived for all causes over-time. Then, search engines for a cause can become useful, as it allows them to niche in specific areas (as good companies usually do), like planting only trees or giving only water. It allows us to spread our searches out over multiple search engines so we can use our searches to solve all problems in a well-rounded manner, ensuring the problem never loses focus. 

Join Earth, Inc. and leverage our platform to help solve Earth-related problems so we can make the Earth a safer place!
